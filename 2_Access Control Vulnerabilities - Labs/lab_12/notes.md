Lab#12 Multi-step process with no access control on one step

Concept : 

    This lab has an admin panel with a flawed multi-step process for changing a user's role. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials administrator:admin.

    To solve the lab, log in using the credentials wiener:peter and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator. 

Steps to exploit :

    1. Log in using the admin credentials.
    2. Browse to the admin panel, promote carlos, and send the confirmation HTTP 
       request to Burp Repeater.
    3. Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin 
       credentials.
    4. Copy the non-admin user's session cookie into the existing Repeater request, 
       change the username to yours, and replay it.
